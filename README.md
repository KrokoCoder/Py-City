This programm-game looks like a city but in Python. 
You can do anything and go anywhere. You have a fully freedom to do things. 
Ofc some parameters will warn you about some actions. 
So welcome to Py-City. Wish you enjoy this interesting place. And wish you become a successful citizen.

To work with Py-City you have lots of commands (actions) that you can do. Like:
work
use-item
buy
sport
sell
lounge
craft
eat
balance
save
inventory
garden
prices
wear
unwear
cook
health
happiness
strength
energy
load
go
travel
claim
sleep

Hope you will enjoy these actions. Each of them have interesting mechanics and even sudden actions. 
Food can spoil if you will not use it long time; 
happiness, health and energy can make an impact on your work and on your earning;
spoiled food costs only half from normal price
and you can also use some interesting items (mystery box, gift box, fishing pole, hunting rifle, jackhammer, pickaxe, car, house, tickets, clothes, medicine, sport equipment, etcâ€¦) 
So hope you will enjoy. And if you will notice some bugs or glitches please write in comments. 
I will be so grateful.
